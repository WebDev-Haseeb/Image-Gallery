# React-JS Gallery Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Image Gallery** project! As a Front-End Developer, I crafted a fully responsive Image Gallery using React JS. This site enables users to add, delete, and search images, presenting them in a gallery view.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Add Images**: Users can upload images directly from their devices.
- **Delete Images**: Users can remove unwanted images from the gallery.
- **Search Images**: Users can search images by tags.

## Demo

Check out the [live demo](https://webdev-image-gallery.vercel.app/) of the Image Gallery.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=18.0.0)
- npm (>=6.0.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WebDev-Haseeb/Image-Gallery
    cd Image-Gallery
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

### Deployment

To deploy the project, you can use services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

1. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder** using your preferred deployment method.
